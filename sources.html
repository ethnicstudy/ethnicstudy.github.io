				We want to provide a platform for discussion and collaboration regarding social, political, economic and cultural issues that arise from the portrayal of ethnicity in media and also analyze how these issues have an impact on the consumer. We would like to develop a common space joining Columbia members from different countries in order to foster interactions and cultural expressions among them.
				Here are the sources we used to inform ourselves and other topic related sources to further educate ourselves.
