				This project was created with the purpose of giving Columbia students a museum experience through a website that allows them to do it from the comfort of their phone. This allows students to scroll through the museum in the library, on the way to class, or right before falling asleep. This new form of attending a museum has the same powerful impact, with no COVID restrictions. 

Nohar and Julia are students in Columbia University taking Introduction to Comparative Ethnic Studies. This class educates students on race and ethnicity and how the two exert powerful effects in society. It also provides historical background and ideas of “ethnic studies” and expresses the importance of the field. Through literature, documentaries, and personal stories this class has made a huge impact on Nohar and Julia.

From Nohar and Julia - 
We both understand the dramatic shift in technology that is happening in the world and agree that the future of spreading information (good and bad) is through networks. This is the reason that we decided to create the museum online to prove that education can happen through your phone and your personal ease and pleasure. We hope you take the time to read through all the powerful covers that we have compiled and understand the importance of media and public education. 

May together we continue to make the world a better place.
